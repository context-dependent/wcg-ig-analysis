## Respondent Information

@tbl-xp-stakeholder-ig reports, for each inclusion group, the number of respondents who indicated that their organization serves that group and the number of organizations that set of respondents represents. 

```{r}
#| label: tbl-xp-stakeholder-ig
#| tbl-cap: "N by inclusion group"

@tbl-xp-stakeholder-org reports the number and percentage of respondents by home organization. For each organization, columns [D] to [S-D] indicate whether any of the respondents from that organization served each inclusion group.

      var = function(x) {
        labs$ig_insights[x] |> 
          stringr::str_extract("(?<=ers - ).*?$") |> 
          stringr::str_replace("\\[Field-1\\]", "[X]")

```

## Success Factors

We asked respondents about the importance of various factors in the employment success of each inclusion group. Responses were collected on a four point scale with the following options: 

1. "Absolutely Necessary"
2. "Very Important"
3. "Somewhat Important"
4. "Not Important"

@tbl-xp-stakeholder-job-factors reports, for each factor and inclusion group, the percentage of respondents who rated the factor as "Absolutely Necessary" or "Very Important".

```{r}
#| label: tbl-xp-stakeholder-job-factors
#| tbl-cap: "Staff-rated job factors (% responding 'Absolutely Necessary' or 'Very Important')"
d |> 
  unnest(ig_loop) |> 
  filter(ig_served) |> 
  select(response_id, ig_short, matches("ig_success_factors")) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = matches("ig_success_factors"), 
    names_to = "var",
    names_transform = list(
      var = function(x) {
        labs$ig_insights[x] |> 
          stringr::str_extract("(?<=ers - ).*?$") |> 
          stringr::str_replace("\\[Field-1\\]", "[X]")
      }
    ),
    values_to = "val"
  ) |>
  mutate(
    x = as.integer(val) < 3
  ) |> 
  group_by(
    ig_short, 
    var
  ) |> 
  summarize(
    x = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = ig_short, values_from = x) |> 
  group_by(var) |> 
  gt() |> 
  gt_theme_538() |> 
  fmt_percent(
    columns = c(-var), 
    decimals = 0
  ) |> 
  tab_header(
    title = "Based on your experiences working with [X], how important are each of the following job features to their sustainable employment?"
  )
```

Using the same scale, we also asked respondents about the importance of various social supports in the employment success of each inclusion group.
@tbl-xp-stakeholder-social-supports reports the percentage of respondents who rated each social support as "Absolutely Necessary" or "Very Important".

```{r}
#| label: tbl-xp-stakeholder-social-supports
#| tbl-cap: "Staff-rated social factors (% responding 'Absolutely Necessary' or 'Very Important')"

d |> 
  unnest(ig_loop) |> 
  filter(ig_served) |> 
  select(response_id, ig_short, matches("ig_social_supports")) |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = matches("ig_social_supports"), 
    names_to = "var",
    names_transform = list(
      var = function(x) {
        labs$ig_insights[x] |> 
          stringr::str_extract("(?<=ers - ).*?$") |> 
          stringr::str_replace("\\[Field-1\\]", "[X]")
      }
    ),
    values_to = "val"
  ) |>
  mutate(
    x = as.integer(val) < 3
  ) |> 
  group_by(
    ig_short, 
    var
  ) |> 
  summarize(
    x = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = ig_short, values_from = x) |> 
  group_by(var) |> 
  gt() |> 
  gt_theme_538() |> 
  fmt_percent(
    columns = c(-var), 
    decimals = 0
  ) |> 
  tab_header(
    title = "Based on your experiences working with [X], how important do each of the following social supports tend to be for their sustainable employment?"
  )
```
