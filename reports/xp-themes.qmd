## Interpretive Guidance

- **What is this?** This page summarizes the key themes that have emerged from our analysis of the survey data collected about the experiences of clients, staff, and stakeholders of Employment Services (ES) in Ontario. It is subject to the same disclaimer as the rest of this exploratory analysis, and should be read as a provisional interpretation of the data. 
- **Why is this?** This page is intended to support meaningful discussion of the preliminary findings and act as a guide for self-guided navigation of the exploratory tables, charts, and text that make up the rest of the section. 
- **Inclusion Groups (IGs)**: This analysis centres the experiences and perspectives of seven inclusion groups: Indigenous persons (IND), Francophones (FRA), Racialized persons (RAC), Persons experiencing Disability (DIS), Newcomers (NEW), and Youth with higher support needs (YTH). These groups are not mutually exclusive, and many survey respondents belong to more than one group. Throughout this summary, these groups are referred to by their abbreviations, not to diminish their complexity, but to make the text more readable and navigable.
- **Generalizability**: The findings presented here are based on non-random samples of clients, staff, stakeholders, and un/underemployed Ontarians. The results described here are therefore not, strictly speaking, generalizable to the broader populations from which those samples were drawn.

## Notable Demographics

### Newcomer Overlap

- NEW is by far the most represented IG in our client sample (@tbl-xp-client-es-ig-rep). 
Of the other IGs, NEW is a minority of only two (IND and DIS). 
Of the FRA or RAC clients we reached, roughly three quarters are also NEW. 
More than half of FRA clients are both NEW and RAC. 
- The upshot is that when we are describing the perspectives of FRA (76% NEW), RAC (74% NEW), YTH (61% NEW), and SA (53% NEW) clients, we are largely describing perspectives formed at the intersection of those identities with the newcomer experience (@fig-xp-client-es-intersections).
- How this affects interpretation is contingent on the extent to which this pattern matches or doesn't match the co-incidence of identities in the broader population of ES clients, a question we can't answer with the data we have. 

### Social Assistance Recipients

- The group of social assistance recipients we reached through both the client and panel surveys reported surprisingly high employment rates and annual incomes (@tbl-xp-client-es-lfs, @tbl-xp-panel-lfs)
- If these figures are accurate, they suggest that the SA Ontarians and ES clients we reached may not be representative of the broader population of SA recipients in Ontario, who are more likely to be unemployed and to have lower incomes.
- Our characterizations of the perspectives they shared should be read with this in mind. 

### Education

- Compared to the general population of Ontarians, our sample is highly educated. 
Whereas roughly a third of Ontario's working age population has a Bachelor's degree, 39% of the clients (@fig-xp-client-es-edu-ecdf) and 54% (!!!) of panel participants (@fig-xp-panel-educ-ecdf) we reached reported having at least a Bachelor's degree. 
- Of note, however, and fitting with high incidence rates of NEW in both samples many of those credentials were obtained internationally. About half of university educated clients and panel participants reported having obtained their highest degree outside of Canada.


## Engaging Inclusion Groups

Across IGs, our analysis suggests that the highest impact opportunities for increasing engagement lie in building a better reputation for effective service delivery by improving client satisfaction. 
From here, we observe a split between one set of IGs (IND, DIS, and SA) whose members are virtually all aware of ES, and so aren't likely to be moved to engage by campaigns that simply raise awareness, and a second set (NEW, YTH, and RAC) whose members are less likely to be aware of ES, and so might be more effectively engaged by campaigns that raise awareness.

### A _Mixed_ Reputation

- Among respondents we reached, overall negative NPS, which tells us that word-of-mouth is likely a slight drag on overall engagement, and that meaningful improvements in client satisfaction could have corresponding positive effects on engagement. (@tbl-xp-client-nps, @tbl-xp-panel-es-nps)
- Across the surveys, there is strong evidence that the reputation is worst among IND clients, and some evidence that YTH, DIS, and NEW clients have more negative perceptions than average.
- In our sample, negative NPS is colocated with disproportionate experiences of gaps in communication, feelings of being misunderstood, and a lack of trust in the intentions of the caseworker (@tbl-xp-client-holistic-sum, @tbl-xp-panel-es-ovr)
- While staff reported broad confidence in their readiness to serve a diverse array of clients, they indicated the most doubt about being equipped to serve DIS, IND, and SA (ODSP) clients (@tbl-xp-staff-challenge)

### Opportunities to do More

- Our analysis suggests convincing aware but unengaged Ontarians that ES can help them achieve their goals and clearly indicating how to access services would move some to engage with ES. Among panel respondents who reported awareness of but not engagement with ES, the most commonly cited reasons for not engaging were, in descending order of frequency (@tbl-xp-panel-es-opt-out): 
  1. I don't believe ES will help me achieve my goals (particularly within DIS)
  2. I am happy with my current employment situation (particularly within SA)
  3. I don't know how to access ES (particularly within IND and NEW)
- If we believe that ES has a reputation problem across IGs, it follows that service delivery improvements that increase client clarity, trust, and satisfaction would result in increased engagement across all groups, but particularly among those who are already aware of ES but not engaged.
- Responses to the panel survey suggest that marketing would reach the most IG members on high-traffic digital platforms like Youtube and Instagram (@tbl-xp-panel-outreach-digital), 
though some physical locations like doctor's offices and libraries remain potentially useful (@tbl-xp-panel-outreach-physical)


## Serving Inclusion Groups

According to the staff and stakeholders we reached, ES clients from across the inclusion group spectrum share many labour market barriers, success factors, and necessary social supports in common. 
Staff emphasized a similar distribution of key challenges they experience when serving clients from different inclusion groups. There are, however, some key differences that are worth noting. 

### Challenges

@tbl-xp-staff-challenge

- Staff most commonly reported that they find connecting clients with employment opportunities to be the most challenging aspect of their work with all inclusion groups except for IND and SA (OW), for whom the most commonly reported biggest challenge is maintaining client engagement, followed by connecting clients with employment opportunities. 
- I want to zoom in on the reported difficulty of maintaining engagement with IND clients, as it is colocated with the lowest (most negative) client NPS scores in our sample, and with the highest rates of distrust and misunderstanding. 

### Barriers 
@tbl-xp-stakeholder-barriers, @tbl-xp-staff-barriers

- According to the staff and stakeholders we reached, IGs share a similar distribution of the barriers about which we inquired with the exception of FRA (who staff and stakeholders seemingly tend to percieve as less barriered than the other groups) 
- Discrimination, either in hiring or on-the-job, was flagged as high-impact barrier in a majority of cases across all groups except FRA and SA (OW)
- DIS, IND, RAC, and SA (ODSP) experience high rates of discrimination both in hiring and on-the-job
- NEW and YTH are more liable to experience discrimination in hiring than on-the-job
- Across all groups, staff flagged missing employability skills as a high-impact barrier more frequently flagged missing technical skills

### Success Factors 
@tbl-xp-stakeholder-job-factors, @tbl-xp-staff-job-factors

- Employer training and skills development opportunities were most frequently flagged as critical across all groups
- Flexible hours especially important for IND, DIS, and SA (ODSP)
- Having colleagues with whom they can identify is most important for IND and SA (ODSP)
- Workplace accommodations are understandably most important for DIS and SA (ODSP)

### Critical Supports
@tbl-xp-stakeholder-social-supports, @tbl-xp-staff-social-supports

- Across inclusion groups and organizations, staff and stakeholders emphasized the value of skills development, flagging the importance of technical skills training, employability skills training, and coaching or mentoring for the achievement of sustainable employment
- Support for disclosing needs and requesting accommodations was flagged as "absolutely necessary" in a majority of responses for DIS, SA (ODSP), and IND 
- English language training was highlighted as a critical support for NEW
