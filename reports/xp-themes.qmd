- For staff and stakeholders, IGs share many labour market barriers, success factors, and necessary social supports in common, but there are several important distinctions
  + Barriers (@tbl-xp-stakeholder-barriers, @tbl-xp-staff-barriers)
    * IG groups share a similar distribution of the barriers about which we inquired with the exception of FRA (who staff and stakeholders seemingly tend to percieve as less barriered than the other groups) 
    + Discrimination, either in hiring or on-the-job, was flagged as high-impact barrier in a majority of cases across all groups except FRA and SA (OW)
    + DIS, IND, RAC, and SA (ODSP) experience high rates of discrimination both in hiring and on-the-job
    + NEW and YTH are more liable to experience discrimination in hiring than on-the-job
    + Across all groups, staff flagged missing employability skills as a high-impact barrier more frequently flagged missing technical skills
  + Success Factors (@tbl-xp-stakeholder-job-factors, @tbl-xp-staff-job-factors)
    * Employer training and skills development opportunities were most frequently flagged as critical across all groups
    * Flexible hours especially important for IND, DIS, and SA (ODSP)
    * Having colleagues with whom they can identify is most important for IND and SA (ODSP)
    * Workplace accommodations are understandably most important for DIS and SA (ODSP)
