As measured by NPS, respondent satisfaction with employment services is quite low. In each inclusion group and in the sample overall, the proportion of respondents in the ‘Promoter’ category is lower than the proportion in the ‘Detractor’ category. The upshot is that, within and around this set of respondents, we would expect word-of-mouth to be a net negative influence on demand for employment services.\nWhile this finding points to the existence of opportunities for improvement across the board, it is also worth noting that the distribution of NPS scores is not uniform across inclusion groups. Indigenous respondents are by far the least likely to be employment services ‘Promoters’ and the most likely to be ‘Detractors’. Individuals experiencing disability follow a similar pattern, though the difference from the sample averge (shown in the ‘Total’ row) is less pronounced.\n\n\nCode\ntbl_nps &lt;- d_long |&gt;\n    filter(engage_reached, !is.na(ux_nps_nps_group)) |&gt;\n    group_by(inclusion_group_label, ux_nps_nps_group) |&gt;\n    summarize(\n        n = n(),\n        .groups = \"drop_last\"\n    ) |&gt;\n    mutate(\n        p = n / sum(n)\n    ) |&gt;\n    select(-n) |&gt;\n    pivot_wider(names_from = ux_nps_nps_group, values_from = p)\n\n\ntbl_nps |&gt;\n    reactable(\n        defaultColDef = colDef(\n            format = colFormat(percent = T, digits = 0)\n        )\n    )\n\n\n\n?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Holistic Reflections\nTable 1.3 summarizes the distribution of responses to holistic reflection questions within each inclusion group. The questions are designed to capture the respondent’s overall experience with employment services. The experiences about which they inquire can be broadly thought of as ‘table stakes’, meaning that they represent a kind of foundational, minimum level of service quality. It feels uncontroversial to suggest that employment services clients should always feel like they know what is happing with their cases, that each activity is productive, and that they are given a safe space in which to discuss their needs. However, among the respondents in this sample, these experiences unfortunately comprise a minority of the total.\n\n\nCode\ntbl_holistic &lt;- d_long |&gt;\n    filter(engage_reached) |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(\n        matches(\"^ux_journey\"),\n        names_to = \"var\",\n        values_to = \"val\"\n    ) |&gt;\n    mutate(\n        lab = unlist(labs[var]) |&gt;
