As measured by NPS, respondent satisfaction with employment services is quite low. In each inclusion group and in the sample overall, the proportion of respondents in the ‘Promoter’ category is lower than the proportion in the ‘Detractor’ category. The upshot is that, within and around this set of respondents, we would expect word-of-mouth to be a net negative influence on demand for employment services.\nWhile this finding points to the existence of opportunities for improvement across the board, it is also worth noting that the distribution of NPS scores is not uniform across inclusion groups. Indigenous respondents are by far the least likely to be employment services ‘Promoters’ and the most likely to be ‘Detractors’. Individuals experiencing disability follow a similar pattern, though the difference from the sample averge (shown in the ‘Total’ row) is less pronounced.\n\n\nShow code\nd_sat &lt;- d_long |&gt; \n    filter(engage_reached) |&gt; \n    mutate(\n        es_promoter = ux_nps_nps_group %in% \"Promoter\", \n        es_detractor = ux_nps_nps_group %in% \"Detractor\",\n        es_nps_marginal = 100 * (es_promoter - es_detractor),\n    ) |&gt; \n    arrange(\n        ig_short\n    ) |&gt; \n    mutate(\n        ig_short = fct_inorder(ig_short)\n    )\n\nt_es_ovr &lt;- d_sat |&gt; \n    group_by(ig = inclusion_group_label) |&gt; \n    summarize(\n        nps = mean(es_nps_marginal),\n        promoter = mean(es_promoter), \n        detractor = mean(es_detractor), \n    )\n\n\nt_es_ovr |&gt;\n    ungroup() |&gt; \n    gt() |&gt; \n    gtExtras::gt_theme_538() |&gt; \n    gtExtras::gt_color_box(\n        columns = c(promoter, detractor),\n        domain = c(0, 1),\n        scale = 100,\n        suffix = \"%\",\n        palette = c(\"#0000FF\", \"#f2f2f2\", \"#ff4500\")\n    ) |&gt; \n    tab_style(\n        style = cell_fill(color = \"gray95\"), \n        locations = cells_body(\n            columns = nps\n        )\n    ) |&gt; \n    fmt_number(columns = nps, decimals = 0) |&gt; \n    tab_footnote(\n        \"NPS is calculated as the difference between the proportion of respondents who are promoters and the proportion who are detractors.\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.12: Client Net Promoter Score by Inclusion Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nig\nnps\npromoter\ndetractor\n\n\n\n\n[DIS] Experiencing Disability\n−22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46%\n\n\n\n\n\n[FRA] Francophone\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36%\n\n\n\n\n\n[IND] Indigenous\n−36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n54%\n\n\n\n\n\n[NEW] Newcomer (2019 or later)\n−11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40%\n\n\n\n\n\n[RAC] Racialized\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32%\n\n\n\n\n\n[SA] Receiving Social Assistance\n−19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45%\n\n\n\n\n\n[YTH] Youth (&lt; 30) with Higher Support Needs\n−12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40%\n\n\n\n\n\n[Z] Total\n−10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNPS is calculated as the difference between the proportion of respondents who are promoters and the proportion who are detractors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.13 shows NPS for members of each pair of inclusion groups.\n\n\nShow code\nd_sat_xy &lt;- d_sat |&gt; \n    select(response_id, ig_x = ig_short, es_nps_marginal) |&gt; \n    left_join(\n        d_sat |&gt; select(response_id, ig_y = ig_short), \n        by = \"response_id\",\n        relationship = \"many-to-many\"\n    ) |&gt; \n    filter(as.integer(ig_x) &gt; as.integer(ig_y))\n    \n\nt_es_ovr_int &lt;- d_sat_xy |&gt; \n    group_by(ig_x, ig_y) |&gt; \n    summarize(\n        nps = mean(es_nps_marginal), \n        .groups = \"drop\"\n    )\n\nt_es_ovr_int |&gt; \n    pivot_wider(names_from = ig_y, values_from = nps) |&gt; \n    gt(rowname_col = \"ig_x\") |&gt; \n    gtExtras::gt_theme_538() |&gt;\n    fmt_missing() |&gt; \n    fmt_number(\n        columns = c(-ig_x), \n        decimals = 0, \n        force_sign = TRUE\n    ) |&gt; \n    tab_header(\n        title = \"Net Promoter Score by Inclusion Group Intersection\"\n    )\n\n\nWarning: Since gt v0.6.0 the `fmt_missing()` function is deprecated and will soon be\nremoved.\n• Use the `sub_missing()` function instead.\nThis warning is displayed once every 8 hours.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.13: Client Net Promoter Score by Inclusion Group Intersection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Promoter Score by Inclusion Group Intersection\n\n\n\n[DIS]\n[FRA]\n[IND]\n[NEW]\n[RAC]\n[SA]\n[YTH]\n\n\n\n\n[FRA]\n−29\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n\n\n[IND]\n−40\n−35\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n\n\n[NEW]\n−23\n−6\n−73\n—\n—\n—\n—\n\n\n[RAC]\n−2\n+3\n—\n+4\n—\n—\n—\n\n\n[SA]\n−26\n+11\n−42\n−21\n+3\n—\n—\n\n\n[YTH]\n−19\n−6\n−25\n−13\n−4\n−19\n—\n\n\n[Z]\n−22\n0\n−36\n−11\n+4\n−19\n−12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Holistic Reflections\nTable 1.14 summarizes the percentage of employment services clients who responded “Always” to a series of questions about their experiences with employment services.\n\n\nShow code\ntbl_holistic_sum &lt;- d_long |&gt;\n    filter(engage_reached) |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(\n        matches(\"^ux_journey\"),\n        names_to = \"var\",\n        values_to = \"val\"\n    ) |&gt;\n    mutate(\n        lab = unlist(labs[var]) |&gt; str_remove(\"^.*?

The questions are designed to capture the respondent’s overall experience with employment services. The experiences about which they inquire can be broadly thought of as ‘table stakes’, meaning that they represent a kind of foundational, minimum level of service quality. It feels uncontroversial to suggest that employment services clients should always feel like they know what is happing with their cases, that each activity is productive, and that they are given a safe space in which to discuss their needs. However, among the respondents in this sample, these experiences unfortunately comprise a minority of the total.\n\n\nShow code\ntbl_holistic &lt;- d_long |&gt;\n    filter(engage_reached) |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(\n        matches(\"^ux_journey\"),\n        names_to = \"var\",\n        values_to = \"val\"\n    ) |&gt;\n    mutate(\n        lab = unlist(labs[var]) |&gt;

    "text": "2.3 Perspectives on Employment Services\n\n2.3.1 Overview (CC-ish)\nTable 2.8 summarizes respondent awareness of, engagement with, and overall reflection on employment services by inclusion group. Awareness of employment services was lowest among youth respondents (67%) and newcomers (68%), and highest among social assistance recipients (93%) and Indigenous respondents (92%). Echoing our analysis of the client survey, we see that employment services has an overall reputation that could charitably be described as ‘mediocre’, and a reputation among Indigenous clients that cannot be charitably described at all. The only inclusion group with a positive NPS (+2) is social assistance reccipients, the same group with the highest rates of awareness and engagement.\nConsidering this from an outreach perspective, these results suggest the following:\n\nThe ‘market’ for employment services among social assistance recipients is saturated. An overwhelming majority of this group’s members are aware of and have engaged with employment services.\nA similar majority of Indigenous respondents (92%) are aware of employment services. A smaller proportion, though still a majority (64%), have engaged with them. The implication here is that simply raising awareness of the existence of employment services won’t engage more Indigenous clients. Instead, a deeper reflection on and transformation of the approach to serving Indigenous clients is needed.\nRespondents with disabilities follow a similar pattern, though with a somewhat lower level of awareness, and a much less acutely negative NPS.\nYouth, newcomers, and racialized individuals represent the largest untapped ‘markets’ for employment services. Raising awareness within these groups is likely to result in increased engagement, though their uniformly negative NPS scores point to opportunities for improvement in the quality of services offered.\n\n\n\nShow code\nt_es_ovr &lt;- d_long |&gt; \n    mutate(\n        es_promoter = es_nps_group %in% \"Promoter\", \n        es_detractor = es_nps_group %in% \"Detractor\",\n        es_nps_marginal = 100 * (es_promoter - es_detractor),\n    ) |&gt; \n    select(\n        ig, \n        es_is_aware, \n        es_client, \n        es_nps_marginal,\n        es_promoter,\n        es_detractor\n    ) |&gt; \n    pivot_longer(c(-ig), names_to = \"var\", values_to = \"val\") |&gt;\n    group_by(ig, var) |&gt; \n    summarize(p = mean(val))\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'ig'.
